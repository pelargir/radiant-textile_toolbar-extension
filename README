= Textile Toolbar Extension for Radiant

Adds toolbars to Textile-enabled text areas in the admin. (This plugin isn't
quite complete yet unfortunately.)

== Installation

From the target Radiant project:
  
  script/extension install textile_toolbar
  
After installing run the migrations and update:
  
  rake radiant:extensions:textile_toolbar:migrate
  rake radiant:extensions:textile_toolbar:update
  
Start your project, login as an admin, and visit the Extensions page. The Textile
Toolbar extension should be listed there.
